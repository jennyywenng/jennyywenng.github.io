						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One thing I learned from this article is that, when picking fonts for children, we need to consider fonts that
								are highly legible and easily readable. Although this makes sense, it surprised me at first because I assumed that 
								fonts for children should be those that are the most playful, engaging, or entertaining for them. I also learned about 
								font pairings, such as looking at the golden ratio or perfect fourths to create different heading sizes. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the parts where they discussed font pairing. I thought it was really interesting to read about
								the different ways of font pairing, from sizes and colors to mix-and-matching and using websites to curate font pairings between
								different fonts. In the past, rather than using the golden ratio or looking at typography websites, I would just experiment and choose
							sizes and combinations that I thought looked good from my perspective, so I'm glad to learn about these resources that will make the process
						more streamlined! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When it comes to choosing type, keep the following principles in mind: readability, legibility, and purpose." </p>
						</li>
