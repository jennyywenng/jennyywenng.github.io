						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One big thing I learned from this article is that there are legal implications surrounding web accessibility. 
								Although this makes sense, it surprised me at first because I had always thought that accessibility was a social 
								standard, not a legal standard. I also learned that there are ways to integrate accessibility other than changing 
								color/font size, such as texture, descriptions, etc.
								 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed the parts of the article where they used images to compare 
								and contrast accesible design vs inaccesible design. It was really useful for me to
								be able to visually see the difference as it helped emphasize why accessibility was so important.
								I also liked that they gave us resources such as Colorable for when we're designing our own pages. 
								 </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Color accessibility enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as their non-visually-impaired counterparts" </p>
						</li>
