                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From this article, I learned that UI interactions can be added on any screen of a platform. Previously, I've seen animations
                                and UI interactions added on loading screens or pages that load as you scroll, but I thought it was really cool how some of these designers were able to incorporate it
                            into other pages such as a welcome screen or a results screen. On the "Index&Sidebar Animation by Arvin," I also learned that interactions can be added to the actual 
                        movement of tapping or swiping as well, as shown by the cursor changing sizes as the user interacts with the page. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was just scrolling through all the examples and being inspired to incorporate aspects of each design or animation into my own work!
                                Specifically, I really enjoyed the interfaces that had mobile animations, because I've made a few mobile prototypes in the past but never really knew
                            the best way to approach adding animations. Whether it was a navigation or a home screen, I thought the designs did a really great job at showing how much animations add to a simple 
                        interface and how they can engage the user that much more. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite of these inspirations was the "AI Powered Assistant by Lubo≈° Volkov." I really liked how dynamic the animations were,
                                and how much detail and thought the designer put into it (ex. the gradient navigation line, the ball/location moving slightly to keep the user engaged, the transparency of the text box).
                                I think this interface was able to reflect its goal as an AI powered assistant by having a design that is sleek, simple, yet makes it easy to manage tasks. I think it
                                is also successful at reflecting AI because of its futuristic color palette and the way the animations put a twist on classic apps like google maps.
