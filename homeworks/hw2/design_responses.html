						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that white space is really important for helping the user maintain focus, and not just for the visual aesthetics of the page. Additionally, I learned that putting in more white space is really good for creating visual distinction and organization so that users get all the information they need without getting overwhelmed. Seeing the screenshots of the Wayfair website/app was really effective in helping me see why white space is more visually appealing and usseful for the everyday user. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed how this article talked about all the different reasons why white space was important, then included images of the Wayfair website or app as an example. Specifically, I really liked how they included side-by-side comparisons of interfaces with good white space and those where everything was cluttered together, as it really helped me visualize the difference. I also liked that they explained why people shouldn't be afraid that white space will push content down and make it harder for users to see, because that's something I always worry about in my designs. </p>
