							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I had previously heard about the gesalt principles, but reading this article taught me how each of them are able to be applied to UI/UX design.
								For example, I learned that we apply the continuity principle when we decide which sections of a webpage we want to break up, or the symmetry principle to keep the page intuitive and comfortable. 
							However, there were also some gesalt principles that I hadn't previously known about, such as "Common Fate," which was really interesting to learn about. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the section after each gesalt principle introduction where they described and showed how it was applicable to UI/UX design.
								For me, it was really helpful to see the visuals of each principle being applied, and it was also really interesting to read the psychological justifications of different design choices.
								For example, I had never noticed that the USA today logo made use of the closure principle/our brains filling in the blanks, so it was really cool to read about how the logo is able to apply the principle to minimize visual noise.  </p>
