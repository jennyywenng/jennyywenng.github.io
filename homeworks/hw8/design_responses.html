						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I had heard about dark patterns in a previous CogSci course, but I was able to learn about the specific types of dark patterns through this article.
							Specifically, I learned about how "misdirection" and "roach motel" are examples of design that trick the user into ending up in situations that they did not sign up for, which
						I thought was interesting because I've seen examples of these in my own life but never realized there was a name and specific strategy behind it. I also learned that disguised ads were
					a purposeful way to make a user click on them, whereas previously I thought it was just bad design without any intention behind it. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was the comparison between dark patterns before the internet (on paper) and dark patterns now digitally. I thought it was interesting to see
							 examples of how dark patterns were used by companies even more digital marketing or user interfaces were popular. Additionally, I also liked how the article showed images as 
							examples of each dark pattern after describing it.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Dark patterns, on the other hand, are not mistakes. They’re carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interest in mind." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
