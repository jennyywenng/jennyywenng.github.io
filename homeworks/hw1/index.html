<p> Hi everyone! I'm Jenny, and I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley. Some fun facts about me are that I grew up in Shanghai, New Zealand, and Southern California, I love listening to Lizzy McAlpine, Harry Styles, and Wolf Alice, and I do contemporary dance and ballet! </p>

    <li> Even though I've had more experience in design than development, I learned from this article how every single design decision should be justified by research or intention.
        For example, even smaller details like which filters are at the top of the Airbnb app have intention behind them, and the word choice for each line is really specific. 
    </li>
    <li>My favorite part of this article was that they incorporated GIFs of the actual app and then an explaination of the design choices. I found it super helpful to see the interface slowly getting put together with the animation and then to be able to read any of the design observations I may have missed. </li>
